Influencer may terminate this Agreement at any time that there is no uncompleted Campaign Invitation in effect upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Onlive Club.

        <p>Severability.

        <p>Injunctive Relief. Influencer acknowledges that, because its services are personal and unique and because Influencer will have access to Confidential Information of Onlive Club, any breach of this Agreement by Influencer would cause irreparable injury to Onlive Club for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and, therefore, will entitle Onlive Club to injunctive relief (including specific performance). The rights and remedies provided to each Party in this Agreement are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies available to such Party at law or in equity.</p>
